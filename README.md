# Project Climate Vault Assessment

Project Climate Vault Assessment is a React application that provides a simple left-hand navigation experience with two main menu items: Report and Configuration.

When the Report page is clicked, the user is presented with a wizard that helps them set up the desired report. The wizard includes options to select date-range, transaction type (estimate, quote, order), and times/amount.

Once the user has submitted the report, a bar chart will be displayed with the results. This chart helps the user quickly make sense of their report's results.
